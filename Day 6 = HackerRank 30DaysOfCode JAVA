Day 6: Let’s Review
Task Given a string, , of length that is indexed from to , print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: is considered to be an even index.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, (the number of test cases). Each line of the subsequent lines contain a String, .

Constraints

1 <= T <= 10
2<= length of S <= 10000
Output Format

For each String (where ), print ‘s even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by ‘s odd-indexed characters.

Sample Input

import java.io.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.security.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Solution {
	import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int T = scan.nextInt();
        String str;

        for(int i=0;i<T;i++){
            str = scan.next();

            for(int j=0;j<str.length();j++){

                if(j%2 ==0){
                    System.out.print(str.charAt(j));
                }
            } 
            System.out.print(" ");
            for(int j=0;j<str.length();j++){
                if(j%2==1){
                    System.out.print(str.charAt(j));
                }

            }
            System.out.println();
        }
        
    }
}


}

I was just vaguely thinking that stdin and stdout were input/output.

I was looking for a scanner to find out.

System.inIt is the scanner class that receives and processes as an input value.

scan.nextLine() takes a string (single line)

scan.nextInt()takes an integer value.

scan.nextDouble()is of type double.

scan.next()accepts a string, input in units of one character.

However, it is said that using the scanner class is not recommended when there are many input values.

It's just a quiz, so it seems like it was made to keep it simple!
